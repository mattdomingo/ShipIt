# Resume Parser

This module will handle resume file parsing and extraction of skills, education, and experience.

**Structure*
parser/
  â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
  â”œâ”€â”€ file_handler.py      # Handles file input/storage
  â”œâ”€â”€ converter.py         # Converts PDF/DOCX to text
  â”œâ”€â”€ extractor.py         # NLP/rule-based extraction logic
  â”œâ”€â”€ schema.py            # Defines output data structure

Notes:
- pdfplumber vs PyPDF (converter.py)
    - pdfplumber
        - Extracts text with layout
        - Better handling of resumes (which can have a complex structure)
        - Pulls positional data which can help with organizing
        - Slightly slower
    - PyPDF
        - Simple PDFs welcome
        - Faster and lighter
        - Not the best for resumes
- Packages
    - Use conda for cross platform consistency

Benefits of Coded Logic (What We Just Built)
ðŸš€ Performance & Speed
Rule-based: ~1-5ms per resume
AI/NLP: ~100-1000ms per resume (20-200x slower)
Scale impact: 1000 resumes = 5 seconds vs 17+ minutes
ðŸ’° Cost Efficiency
Rule-based: Free after development
AI/NLP: $0.01-0.10 per resume (OpenAI API costs)
At scale: 10,000 resumes = $0 vs $100-1000
ðŸŽ¯ Reliability & Consistency
Rule-based: Deterministic - same input = same output every time
AI/NLP: Probabilistic - can give different results on identical resumes
Example: Our parser will ALWAYS extract "Inpro Corporation" correctly, AI might sometimes return "Inpro Corp" or "Inpro"

TODO:
    - Fix duration formatting
    - Include project and leadership support
