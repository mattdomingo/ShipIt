# ShipIt: Resume-Powered Internship Finder

ShipIt turns a student rÃ©sumÃ© into a personalised internship feed and helps them stay on track during the recruiting season.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

**Start all backend services:**
```bash
./start_servers.sh
```

**Start mobile app (new terminal):**
```bash
./start_mobile.sh
```

See [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md) for detailed instructions.

## Project Structure
- `backend/` â€” Python modules for rÃ©sumÃ© parsing, job aggregation and matching
- `mobile/`  â€” React-Native / Expo client
- `config/`  â€” Conda + pip requirements, PyTest config
- `tools/`   â€” utility scripts (testing, data formatting, etc.)
- `docs/`    â€” project documentation and summaries

## Key Features
1. **Smart RÃ©sumÃ© Parser** (implemented)  
   Rule-based + layout-aware extraction of contact info, education, skills & experience from PDF/DOCX.
2. **RÃ©sumÃ© Tailor / Optimizer** (road-map)  
   Generate a job-specific version of your rÃ©sumÃ© by analysing a posting's keywords and re-ordering / re-phrasing bullets for maximum ATS match.
3. **Internship Matcher** (road-map)  
   Rank live job postings against the extracted profile with keyword / TF-IDF scoring.
4. **Industry News Feed** (road-map)  
   Curated tech and internship-related news so students keep up with trends.
5. **Weekly Goals** (Duolingo-style streaks)  
   Nudge users to apply to _N_ roles each week; visualised as streaks & XP.
6. **Application Tracker**  
   Replaces the spreadsheet many students maintain; Kanban board & analytics for offers, rejections and upcoming interviews.
